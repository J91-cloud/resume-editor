> **⚠️ Warning:**  
> This project was to facilitate the way i make my resumes when applying for a job.

With using multiple python libraries i will be able to select and choose which projects i want on my resume. 

The issue i had with this is that sometimes a job description would require different types of projects needed, whetehr it was a front-end or backend job application.
